# JEAT - A Java Port of the NEAT Algorithm

This is a Java port of the NEAT algorithm, which is a method for evolving artificial neural networks
through a process that mimics biological evolution. The original algorithm was created by Kenneth O.
Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen in 2002. This port is based on the original paper, which can be
found [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
